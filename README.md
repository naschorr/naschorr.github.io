## Building and Serving
- `cd` to the root directory
- Run `npm start` or `ng serve` to build and host the site locally. To expose the site to your local network, use `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0`.
- Connect to the page at [localhost:4200](localhost:4200), or [<host's IP address>:4200](localhost:4200) if you're accessing the site from a phone or something else.
